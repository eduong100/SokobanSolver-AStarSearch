# Sokoban Solver with A* Search (UCLA Intro to Artificial Intelligence)
Grade: A

<h2>Overview:</h2>

<h3>What is Sokoban? (from Wikipedia)</h3>

Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes crates or boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations. The game was designed in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and first published in December 1982.

The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations.

The player is confined to the board and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can move a box by walking up to it and pushing it to the square beyond. Boxes cannot be pulled, and they cannot be pushed to squares with walls or other boxes. The number of boxes equals the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are placed at storage locations.

<h3>Technology and Algorithms</h3>

Using lisp as the primary programming language, we used the A* search algorithm to create a Sokoban solver that finds an optimal solution to the game (a solution with the minimum number of moves). A* is capable of finding an optimal solution with any admissible heuristic, but we designed and implemented our own heuristic to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. To motivate students to design the best heuristics possible, instructors graded students in a competition format where higher grades went to individuals who outperformed their peers. In creating this repository, I hope to document this project, explain how the A* algorithm works, and explain my heuristic choice. 

<h2>A* Search</h2>

A* is an informed graph traversal/search algorithm that is guided by a heuristic function h(n). The algorithm searches for the “shortest” path between an initial and final state in the graph. In the case of Sokoban, our final state is when all boxes are properly placed and our shortest path is the smallest set of moves needed for the player to push the boxes into place. A* works by exploring states one after the other, building out its own version of the graph in memory. The only viable states that can be expanded are those adjacent to states that have already been expanded. In each step of the algorithm, A* chooses to expand the state/node that minimizes f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where g(n) is the cost of reaching a specific node “n” and h(n) is our heuristic function. The heuristic is meant to be an optimistic estimate of how “close” we are to the end goal. To be admissible, h(n) should never be more than the cost of the shortest path from the node “n” to our end goal. The algorithm ends once the end goal is expanded. 

A* always finds the shortest path if given an admissible heuristic. However, better heuristics will cause A* to expand better nodes first leading to the correct solution faster. Below is an example of A* working its way through a maze. The green squares are nodes that can be expanded next. The red ones are previously expanded nodes. And the blue is the optimal path to the current node (the cost of which is measured by g(n)). The heuristic used is the Manhattan distance between node n to the end node.

<h2>Heuristics</h2>

I implemented a heuristic function that uses a combination of deadlock and Manhattan-distance checking. In Sokoban, a deadlock occurs when the player pushes a box into a spot such that the box becomes stuck. When this occurs, the game becomes impossible to solve given that at least one box can no longer be pushed into a goal. Thus, A* search does not need to expand board states in which a deadlock occurs and our heuristic takes that into account. For non-deadlocked states, our heuristic measures the sum of manhattan distances of each box to its closest goal. Thus our A* search tends to favor states in which the player successfully moves a box closer to a goal (without causing a deadlock). This “smartManhattan” heuristic has a notable speedup in comparison to the two other given heuristics in this file (the trivial “0” heuristic and the number of misplaced boxes heuristic). For particular boards, the smartManhattan heuristic will expand only a fifth of the number of nodes compared to the other heuristics before finding an optimal solution.

<h2>How to Run:</h2>

Have a working and updated clisp shell to run the following code
Load dependencies with `(load "a-star.lsp")` and `(load "sokoban.lsp")`
Now you have two options, you can see a step-by-step playthrough of the game with

`(printStates (sokoban INPUT-BOARD HEURISTIC) DELAY-BETWEEN-STATES)`

OR, you can simply view a list of consecutive states with
`(sokoban INPUT-BOARD HEURISTIC)`

Example boards are given towards the end of the README and sokoban.lsp. See an example run through below:

To view a playthrough of board five using the smartManhattan heuristic with a delay of 0.15 seconds, do

`(printStates (sokoban p5 #'smartManhattan) 0.15)`

<h2>Example Boards:</h2>

Each problem can be visualized by calling (printstate <problem>). For example, (printstate p1).
Problems are roughly ordered by their difficulties. In each problem listed, the first number represents the the nodes expanded by A* with the trivial heuristic
while the second represents the length of the optimal path.
